RestApiExample is a set of scripts that are used to test 
http://dummy.restapiexample.com

Please use these scripts responsibly and do not hammer the server.

There is a base class which contains all action methods.
Test classes can then extend the base class.

I have also added a console output formating listener
which adds a header for each test in the console output.


NOTE:   This project no longer works 100% due to recent changes made server-side.
		I have been in touch with the site admin, and will apply updates after server-side fixes are set in place.
