RestApiExample is a set of scripts that are used to test 
http://dummy.restapiexample.com

Please use these scripts responsibly and do not hammer the server.

There is a base class which contains all action methods.
	- Test classes can then extend the base class.

There is a custom TestNG listener to customize console output.
	- Adds a header in the console output for each test that is ran.


NOTE:   This project currently does not works 100% due to server-side errors during their recent updates.
		I have been in touch with the site admin, and will apply updates once server-side fixes are set in place.

Run the TestNG xml files as TestNG Suites.
